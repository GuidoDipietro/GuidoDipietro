# Hey! 🐉 I'm Guido Dipietro

### [Speedcuber](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2013DIPI01) and Information Systems Engineer based in Buenos Aires.

Currently building on Solana, experienced in Algorand and Ethereum too.  

I enjoy programming and human languages, and have a special appeal towards [esoteric coding](https://github.com/GuidoDipietro/taoprintf-project).  

Passionate about travelling! Hopefully I'll be able to visit every country one day! 🌍 🌎 🌏

### Solana stuff

Mostly examples and proof of concepts of uncommon topics. Worth taking a look!
