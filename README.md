# Hey! 🐉

## I'm Guido Dipietro, [speedcuber](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2013DIPI01) and student of Information Systems Engineering based in Buenos Aires.

As to programming, I mostly code in C just for fun, or in Python if I actually want to get something done.   

I am really curious about programming languages and how they're structured, and have a special appeal towards [esotericism](https://github.com/GuidoDipietro/taoprintf-project).  

I also enjoy learning _human_ languages and facts about countries. Hopefully I'll be able to visit them all one day! 🌍 🌎 🌏
