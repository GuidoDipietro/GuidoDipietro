### Hey! üêâ

#### I'm Guido Dipietro, [speedcuber](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2013DIPI01) and student of Information Systems Engineering based in Buenos Aires.

As to programming, I mostly code in Python just for fun, and I've been learning about full-stack web development as well as low-level C applications during lockdown.  

I'm really interested in programming languages and how they're structured, and have a special appeal towards esotericism.
